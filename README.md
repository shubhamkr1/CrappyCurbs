# CrappyCurbs

The Goal

To facilitate access for people with disabilities (hearing, visual, mobile), elderlies,

persons with toddlers, temporary disabled people:

 Route-planning tool that finds sidewalks with no steep inclines or declines,

minimum crossing for visually impaired, well-maintained sidewalks and curb

cuts, optimal distance from point A to point B

 Crowdsourcing platform to collect #CrappyCurb and address the issue of

accessibility and mobility to the city government and maintenance engineers

 Support and Empowerment Chamber, where all, who are concerned about

equity issues, can collaborate, participate, share ideas and organize together for

change

 Talking Map for visually impaired students, teachers, or visitors, which would

help them navigate the campus with and without Wi-Fi access (pronouncing the

street names and building names)

 Tutorial from Rooted in Rights on how to collect the information about crappy

curb cuts and sidewalks
